## Lessons Learned

Front-end Development: I learned how to create a user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to collect movie details from users through a form.

React and Redux: I used React to manage the state of the application and implemented Redux for state management, which allowed me to efficiently handle data flow and manage the application's global state.

Data Manipulation: I learned how to manipulate and handle JSON data, such as reading from and writing to a JSON file.

## Challenges and Solutions:

Redux Setup: Implementing Redux for state management was a challenge, especially when connecting the store with components. I overcame this by following Redux documentation and tutorials to set up the store and actions correctly.

Overall, building this movie project was a rewarding experience that deepened my understanding of web development concepts and improved my problem-solving skills. By overcoming challenges and actively learning new techniques, I was able to create a functional and user-friendly movie website.
